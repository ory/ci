    description: >
      If in a pull request, checks out the pull request's HEAD SHA instead of a
      merge commit. Else, the usual behavior of actions/checkout is followed.
  token:
    description: >
      Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. The PAT is configured
      with the local git config, which enables your scripts to run authenticated git
      commands. The post-job step removes the PAT.
      We recommend using a service account with the least permissions necessary.
      Also when generating a new PAT, select the least scopes necessary.

  ssh-key:
    description: >
      SSH key used to fetch the repository. The SSH key is configured with the local
      git config, which enables your scripts to run authenticated git commands.

  ssh-known-hosts:
    description: >
      Known hosts in addition to the user and global host key database. The public
      SSH keys for a host may be obtained using the utility `ssh-keyscan`. For example,
      `ssh-keyscan github.com`. The public key for github.com is always implicitly added.
  ssh-strict:
    description: >
      Whether to perform strict host key checking. When true, adds the options `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes`
      and `CheckHostIP=no` to the SSH command line. Use the input `ssh-known-hosts` to
      configure additional hosts.
    default: true
  persist-credentials:
    description: 'Whether to configure the token or SSH key with the local git config'
    default: true

    description: 'Whether to execute `git clean -ffdx && git reset --hard HEAD` before fetching'

  fetch-depth:
    description: 'Number of commits to fetch. 0 indicates all history for all branches and tags.'

  submodules:
    description: >
      Whether to checkout submodules: `true` to checkout submodules or `recursive` to
      recursively checkout submodules.
      When the `ssh-key` input is not provided, SSH URLs beginning with `git@github.com:` are
      converted to HTTPS.
