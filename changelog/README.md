# "Create CHANGELOG.md" GitHub Action

This GitHub Action generates, formats, and commits CHANGELOG.md files.

### Development

To generate the changelog for a repository on your dev machine:

- clone the repository
- `cd` into its repository
- run `bash create_changelog.sh` (adjust the path to point to the
  `create_changelog.sh` file in this repo)

Run `make` to see all available housekeeping tasks.
